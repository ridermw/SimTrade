# Planning Index

This folder captures all pre-implementation planning for Milestone 1.

## Milestone 1 Artifacts

- `milestone-01-feature-breakdown.md`: Feature list, scope boundaries, dependencies, and acceptance criteria.
- `milestone-01-delivery-sequence.md`: Implementation order, branch strategy, and release gates.
- `milestone-01-issue-drafts.md`: Ready-to-copy GitHub issue drafts with labels and done criteria.

## Rule for Milestone 1

No application code changes should start until all Milestone 1 issues are created and linked to these planning docs.
